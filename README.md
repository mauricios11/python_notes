# python notes

#### By: mauricio :t-rex:

#### Description
This repository contains notes taken during classes python with the languaje tools
- some of the notes are written twice: in a pyfile and in a jupyter nb

## Directories:
- ### **Basics** 
   - basic concepts (.py and ipynb files)
 - #### pyfiles:
    - *operators* `and` / `or`
    - *booleans*
    - `for` *loops*
    - slices `[:]`
 
 - #### jupyter nb:
    - nested loops
    - dicts
    - sets
    - list's

**final project**: piedra papel ó tijera game


- ### **intermediate** 
   - complexity of the concepts is a little higher (.py, .csv and ipynb files) 
- #### pyfiles:
  - list comprehensions
  - dict comprehensions
  - funcions
  - lambda functions
  - read files
  - overwrite files
  - packages

  *& jupyter nb's are mostly the same concept but with a more extensive explanation:*

**final project**: plot the population of a country using an imported dataset (without using pandas)

-  All scripts must be modularized. Which will be initializing from a main file
